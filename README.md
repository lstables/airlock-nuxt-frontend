Here's how I got Laravel Airlock working with NuxtJS and the native Authentication module: [https://serversideup.net/using-laravel-airlock-with-nuxtjs/](https://serversideup.net/using-laravel-airlock-with-nuxtjs/)

# AirlockNuxt

> Testing Laravel Airlock with Nuxt

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
